      The model takes information about possible crop rotations, land capability,
      current field usage and temporal/spatial constraints on cropping and
      simulates cropping patterns across each field for a given number of years.
      This is achieved through stochastic simulation of field usage using different
      transition matrices for different land capabilities (all within the specified
      constraints).

    name: Western (Basalt) Plains Natural Temperate Grassland
    description: |
      The native Western (Basalt) Plains Natural Temperate Grassland to the west of Melbourne is one of Australia’s most
      endangered vegetation types with over 99.5% of its original distribution having been lost or substantially altered. It supports a diversity of animal species, including
      eight nationally threatened species. The remaining remnants predominantly occur on private land (DNRE, 1997) and continue to face a number of threats including inappropriate grazing or fire regimes, weed invasion, inappropriate herbicide use and the application of fertilizers.
      The condition of native grassland is expected to change depending on its management status. This elicitation exercise aims at discovering your beliefs about the rate of change for grassland in two different categories: managed and unmanaged. Land is considered to be managed when it is within a public reserve or private land incentive program. Unmanaged land is grassland on private land subject to entitled uses (such as grazing) and uncontrolled threats (such as perennial weed invasion). There will be variation among the grasslands in the two categories, and so it is important that you include this uncertainty in the values you submit. You can do this by specifying ranges and quartiles.

    research_objective: |
      <p>The research aims to characterise and quantify spatial variation of
      variable Y in soil surface in area X. Results of the research will be used
      for scientific report only. The main audiences of the report will be
      students (mainly graduate), experts and scientists in soil science.</p>
    outline: |
      <p>The elicitation procedure has two main rounds. The first round is
      elicitation of marginal continuous distribution of variable Y at random
      location in study area X. The second is the elicitation of the variogram.
      Each round will take around 30 minutes to complete with four questions in
      round 1 and seven questions in round 2. Round 2, however, will not be
      proceeded immediately after round 1. There will be a
      seven&ndash;day&ndash;break in between two rounds to allow all experts
      modifying their judgements.</p>
    variable_characteristics: |
      <p>Variable Y is topsoil property. The study area X is located in lowland
      area in the south-west delta of the Netherlands. This is the delta of the
      Rhine-Meuse River near Rotterdam.</p>
    elicitation_techniques: |
      <p>To characterise marginal distribution, the quartile method is used. In
      this method, experts will be asked to judge value of median, and upper and
      lower quartiles. Besides, experts will be asked to judge the maximum and
      the minimum value of Y as well.  To characterise the variogram, the
      technique vary between two kind of marginal distributions: normal and
      log-normal. In case of Gaussian random field, experts will be asked to
      give judgements for the median of each difference in value between two
      locations. In case of log-normal random field, the ratio of difference,
      which is assumed to be a factor of lager value over smaller value, will be
      elicited.</p>

      <p>Experts participating in this research are kindly required to provide
      personal data. Experts are kindly required to involve in 2 rounds of
      elicitation procedure.</p>
    bias_causes: |
      <p>Experts can possibly make biased judgements. Some causes of biased
      judgments that experts are kindly asked to be aware of when giving
      judgements:</p><ol><li>Availability bias: judgements given by
      experts are affected by easy recall of recent experience.</li><li>
      Representativeness bias: judgements given by experts are based on
      inappropriate or too specific evidences.</li><li>Anchoring and
      adjustment: experts judge by first choosing a starting point as first
      estimation and then adjusting the estimation.</li><li>Motivational
      bias: judgements given by experts are motivated by inappropriate factors
      such as satisfying expectation of society, legal constraints, and
      professional responsibility.</li></ol>

    research_objective: |
      <p>Unmanaged grasslands have been observed to degrade over time, while managed grasslands generally improve in quality. However, once a patch of grassland falls below a certain condition threshold, it is difficult to fully restore it to a state where it can support many of the original species. This part of the elicitation is about the level of condition at which you believe this threshold lies.

      <ul>
      <li>the median (the level at which you believe this threshold is most likely to lie)</li>
      <li>the minimum and maximum (the condition levels outside which you are sure it does not lie)</li>
