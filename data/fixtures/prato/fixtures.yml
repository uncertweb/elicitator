    name: Matthew Williams
    description: |
      Matthew is a research fellow at Aston University. Despite his huge popularity, relatively little is known about this handsome individual.
      The UK government has therefore commissioned an investigation into Matthew's lifestyle to try and understand more about him. The results will
      provide the backbone of a new cloning initiative that aims to produce 1,000,000 Matthews by the year 2020. Something we can all look forward to!

  cont_example:
    name: Matthew's current blood alcohol content
    variable_type: Continuous
    deadline: '2011-09-27'
    research_objective: |
      <p>It is a well known fact that Matthew enjoys a drink in the evening. However, we wish
      to know his blood alcohol content on a typical Monday afternoon.</p>
    variable_characteristics: |
      <p>Blood alcohol content (BAC), also called blood alcohol concentration, blood ethanol concentration, or blood alcohol level is most commonly used as a metric of alcohol intoxication for legal or medical purposes.
      Blood alcohol content is usually expressed as a percentage of alcohol in the blood. For instance, a BAC of 0.10 means that 0.10% (one tenth of one percent) of a person's blood is alcohol.</p>
    bias_causes: |
      <p>Experts can possibly make biased judgements. Some causes of biased
      judgments that experts are kindly asked to be aware of when giving
      judgements:</p><ol><li>Availability bias: judgements given by
      experts are affected by easy recall of recent experience.</li><li>
      Representativeness bias: judgements given by experts are based on
      inappropriate or too specific evidences.</li><li>Anchoring and
      adjustment: experts judge by first choosing a starting point as first
      estimation and then adjusting the estimation.</li><li>Motivational
      bias: judgements given by experts are motivated by inappropriate factors
      such as satisfying expectation of society, legal constraints, and
      professional responsibility.</li></ol>

      <p>
      We all like ice-cream. Matthew is no exception. However, his favourite flavour ice-cream is a closely guarded secret.
      If we could obtain this secret information it would prove invaluable in our cloning program.
